## Project Overview

The Staybnb is built using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, MongoDB, NextAuth, and Redux.

Some of the features implemented in this project include:

- User authentication using NextAuth, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
- Listings page where users can browse and search for accommodations based on various filters.
- Detailed listing view with information about the property, including photos, amenities, location, and availability.
- Booking functionality that enables users to select dates, specify the number of guests, and make reservations.
- The technologies used in this project provide a robust foundation for building a scalable and interactive web application. With Next.js, server-side rendering is achieved for improved performance and SEO. React helps create reusable components, while Tailwind CSS simplifies the styling process. Prisma and MongoDB handle data management, and Redux offers centralized state management.
- Real-time messaging chat functionality was implemented using Pusher. This feature allows tenants to communicate directly with hosts in real-time, facilitating quick and efficient conversations. Pusher ensures that messages are delivered instantly, maintaining a seamless flow of communication between tenants and hosts. With this functionality, tenants can inquire about property details, discuss specific requirements, and get prompt responses from hosts, enhancing their overall booking experience. The integration of Pusher adds an interactive and dynamic element, further replicating the real-time communication experience provided of website.

This project provides a hands-on learning experience and an opportunity to explore the implementation of key features found in a popular real-world application.
